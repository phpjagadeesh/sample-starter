# Conceptual Aside

Here we have three important concepts 

### Syntax Parser
The syntax parser is translate human readable code to computer instruction through interpreter or compailer.

### Lexical Enviorment
The Lexical enviorment means where the code is actually sitting

```function hello() {
    var a = 0;
}```

Here a is lexically inside the function 'hello'
